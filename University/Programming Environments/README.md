# Programming Environments Course Project
## Programming Language: C++

My task was to create a class, an instance of which keeps a list that holds the coordinates of line segments. The task was a part of a larger assignment. The assignement had to draw random lines on the screen every 50 ms and if the lines collide, all the colliding lines are to be deleted. My class and list keep the coordinates of each of the lines and every cicle the content of the list is to be printed. It has the functionality to add, check and remove lines. More info on the class in the Collision.h file!
